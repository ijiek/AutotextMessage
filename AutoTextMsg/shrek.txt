                         Once upon a time there was a lovely
                         princess. But she had an enchantment
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could
                         only be broken by love's first kiss.
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
                         Many brave knights had attempted to
                         free her from this dreadful prison,
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of
                         the tallest tower for her true love
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs)
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go
               after the ogre.
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME
                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?
                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!
                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that
                         thing can do to you?
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's
                         bread.
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly
                         peeled skin.
                                     MEN
                         No!
                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's
                         quite good on toast.
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the
               men are in the dark.
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away.
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted.
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
               THE NEXT DAY
               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three
               little pigs.
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!
                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that!
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the
                         broom in half)
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.
                         Next!
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.
                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please!
                         Give me another chance!

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his
                         nose grows)

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy.
                         Take it away.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this!
                         Help me!

               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up
               to the table.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,
                         if you can prove it.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!


                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing
                         you ever saw.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink
                         to the ground.)

               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)
                         After him!

                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way!
                         Turn!

               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He
               quickly hides behind Shrek.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized
                         to place you both under arrest and transport
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.


                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and
               begins walking back to his cottage.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen,
                         you was really, really, really somethin'
                         back here. Incredible!

                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back
                         around and Donkey is right in front
                         of him.) Whoa!

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell
                         you that you that you was great back
                         here? Those guards! They thought they
                         was all of that. Then you showed up,
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves
                         like babes in the woods. That really
                         made me feel good to see that.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?


                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll
                         stick with you. You're mean, green,
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses
                         us.

               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very
               loudly.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't
                         work, your breath certainly will get
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking
                         out of my butt that day.

                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have
                         faith...

                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't
                         have any friends.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that
                         cruelly honest.

                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at
                         me. What am I?

                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really
                         tall?

                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that
                         bother you?

                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me
                         thing. I like that. I respect that,
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live
                         in place like that?

                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
                         You know you are quite a decorator.
                         It's amazing what you've done with such
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder.
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you
                         don't entertain much, do you?

                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when
                         you got somebody in your face. You've
                         trying to give them a hint, and they
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence.
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?


                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there!
                         You don't know what it's like to be
                         considered a freak. (pause while he
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.
                         But that's why we gotta stick together.
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!


                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)


                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto
                         a chair.) No! No!

                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,
                         I don't know you, and you don't know
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's
                         no one here beside me...

               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a
               noise. He stands up with a huff.

                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to
                         stay outside.

                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the
                         farm, but what choice do we have?


                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.


                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.


                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes
                         and lands on his shoulder.)

                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's
                         ear)

                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped
                         from behind and he drops the mice.)
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.


                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The
                         bed's taken.

                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at
               him.

                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging
               him to the front door.

                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,
                         no. No! No!

               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.


                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)


               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a
               tent.

                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you,
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no!
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to
                         look at Donkey)

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite
                         them.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.


                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where
                         this Farquaad guy is?

               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find
                         him? Anyone at all?

                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!
                         Me, me!

                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable.
                         Your welcome is officially worn out.
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad
                         right now and get you all off my land
                         and back where you came from! (Pause.
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)
                         You! You're comin' with me.

                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear,
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city
                         adventure. I love it!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get
                         on the road again.

                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.


               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.


                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run,
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash,
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell
                         me! Where are the others?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's
                         eye.)

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures.
                         Now my patience has reached its end!
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)


                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop
                         buttons.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?


                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the
                         muffin man?
